# OFFICIAL AMPLIFIER "STUFF" DIRECTORY

This directory contains the official amplifier directory of "stuff".

Stuff includes:

- agents
- commands
- contexts
- modes
- tools

When you run `amplifier directory --fetch`, these items (by default) are fetched into your `.amplifier/directory`.

You can copy this directory to manage your own. Just update your `.amplifier/config.yaml` to point to your own, either in a git repo or in a local directory.
