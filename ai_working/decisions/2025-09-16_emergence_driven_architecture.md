# Decision Record: Adopting Emergence-Driven Architecture

## Context
Analyzing alignment between emergence principles and our existing ruthless simplicity and "bricks and studs" philosophy to establish best practices for architectural evolution.

## Decision
Adopt emergence-driven architecture focused on ultra-clear interfaces between minimal components, allowing complex patterns to arise naturally from real usage rather than upfront design.

## Core Implementation Principles

1. Interface-First Development
- Document public contracts in README/interface files
- Version all public interfaces
- Require RFC for interface changes
- Enforce aggressive interface stability

2. Minimal Viable Components
- Start with smallest possible interface
- Let complexity emerge from usage
- Document discovered patterns immediately
- Regular pattern review sessions

3. Measurement Framework
- Interface Stability: Changes per quarter
- Pattern Discovery: New patterns documented
- Reuse Rate: Component combinations
- Adaptation Speed: Time to implement changes

## Benefits
- Natural evolution to meet actual needs
- Reduced upfront architecture overhead
- Patterns emerge from real usage
- Clear boundaries reduce refactoring scope

## Risks
- May miss important architectural needs
- Different teams may see different patterns
- Interfaces may evolve incompatibly
- Risk of over-simplification

## Success Criteria
Architecture emerges successfully when:
1. New patterns are discovered and documented regularly
2. Interface stability metrics improve over time
3. Component reuse increases
4. Changes can be implemented faster

## Review Triggers
Review this decision if:
- Interface change frequency increases
- Pattern discovery rate drops
- Component reuse decreases
- Change implementation slows
