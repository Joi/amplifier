# Module Generator (Claude SDK) – Work-In-Progress Report

## Scope
Build and harden the `module-generator` CLI that reads a contract/spec pair, consults Claude Code SDK in plan + build phases, and scaffolds a Python module (used Idea Synthesizer as sample payload).

## Timeline Snapshot
1. **Discovery & Setup** – Collected ideation notes (`ChatGPT-Module contract ideation.md`) and drafted contract/spec + initial example plan under `ai_working/module_generator_example/`.
2. **Planning Enhancements** – Added prompt previews, message normalization, and streaming JSONL logs (`plan.messages.jsonl`) so each run has an auditable trail. Stored plan artifacts in `ai_working/module_generator_runs/<module>/`.
3. **Timeout Removal** – Replaced wall-clock timeouts with turn caps; surfaced warnings when Claude returns `error_max_turns`; exposed `--plan-max-turns` / `--generate-max-turns` CLI options.
4. **Execution Pass** – Ran the generator end-to-end producing the sample module (Idea Synthesizer). Message logs captured all tool invocations, lint/test attempts, todo updates, and run telemetry.
5. **Post-run Hardening** – Added telemetry helpers, atomic write utilities, deterministic ID fixes, and detailed SDK logging. Documented patterns for future SDK-driven tools.

## Deliverables In-Repo
- `ai_working/module_generator_example/` – Sample plan, contract, and spec used to drive the generator.
- `ai_working/module_generator_runs/` – Per-run plan/generation logs (text + JSONL + usage metrics) for reproducibility.
- `ai_working/wip_reports/idea_synthesizer_module_generator/` – Session write-up (`README.md`) and SDK pattern notes (`ccsdk_patterns.md`).

## Current Status
- `module-generator` CLI supports:
  - Planning phase with message logging and actionable TODOs.
  - Generation phase without enforced timeouts; message streams saved to disk.
  - Configurable turn caps; prompt previews in logs; re-usable telemetry + atomic writes.
- `pytest tests/module_generator -q` passes (verifies CLI behaviour).
- Remaining work tracked separately (functional polish, module-specific tests, type-check tidy-up).

## Lessons Learned / Patterns
- **Observability First** – Prompt previews + message descriptors + JSONL logs greatly simplify debugging and should be standard for Claude-based tooling.
- **Turn Caps > Timeouts** – Long multi-hour sessions are viable; rely on max turns and TODO tracking rather than wall-clock limits.
- **Store Artifacts** – Keeping plan/spec/contract plus per-run logs in `ai_working/` gives both human and automated agents context without chat transcripts.
- **Telemetry Hooks** – Provide timers, event logging, and atomic metrics saves; re-use across future generators.
- **Atomic Writes from Async** – Wrap synchronous file writes via `asyncio.to_thread` instead of rewriting utilities.

## Next Steps
- Finish polishing the sample module/tests (tracked separately).
- Extract SDK logging/streaming utilities into a reusable helper package.
- Consider publishing a `ccsdk-toolkit` skeleton that wires prompt previews, logging, telemetry, and artifact storage by default.

## Session Narrative (Condensed)
1. Seeded module-generator idea with contract/spec + plan example.
2. Instrumented planning phase (previews, JSONL) and removed hard timeouts.
3. Ran generator, captured run artifacts, and inspected outputs.
4. Hardened CLI utilities (telemetry, atomic writes, deterministic IDs).
5. Documented patterns + remaining follow-ups for future Claude SDK automations.
