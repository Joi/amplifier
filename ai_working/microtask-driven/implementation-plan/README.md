# Amplifier CLI Tool Builder - Implementation Plan

## Mission Statement

Build a meta-tool that creates other Amplifier CLI Tools, demonstrating the microtask-driven architecture pattern while serving as both the exemplar implementation and the tool generator for future tools.

## Project Overview

The **Amplifier CLI Tool Builder** is a sophisticated tool that embodies the Amplifier Pattern philosophy: "Code for Structure, AI for Intelligence." It will serve as both:

1. **The Exemplar Tool** - Demonstrating all key patterns and best practices
2. **The Meta-Tool** - Creating other Amplifier CLI Tools based on specifications

This tool will use the Claude Code SDK to break complex tool creation into focused microtasks, each taking 5-10 seconds of AI processing, with code handling orchestration, state management, and reliability.

## Core Value Proposition

- **For Individual Developers**: Create production-quality AI tools in hours instead of weeks
- **For Teams**: Standardized, maintainable AI-enhanced tools with clear patterns
- **For Organizations**: Reduced development costs with 60-80% lower AI API usage

## Key Deliverables

1. **amplifier-tool-builder CLI** - The main command-line tool
2. **Pattern Library** - Reusable microtask patterns
3. **Template System** - Tool scaffolding and generation
4. **Quality Verification** - Automated testing and validation
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples

## Architecture Highlights

- **Microtask Decomposition**: Every AI call focused on a single, 5-10 second task
- **Progressive Specialization**: General → Domain-specific → Task-specific → Metacognitive
- **Incremental Persistence**: Never lose work, save after every atomic operation
- **Re-entrant Design**: Tools can improve their own output iteratively
- **Custom Tools via MCP**: Extend capabilities with domain-specific operations

## Success Metrics

- Generate a complete Amplifier CLI Tool in 10-15 minutes
- 95%+ of generated tools pass quality verification
- 5-10 seconds average per microtask
- Zero data loss even with interruptions
- Self-improving through metacognitive analysis

## Development Philosophy

Following the core Amplifier principles:
- **Ruthless Simplicity**: Every component does one thing well
- **Code for Structure**: Python/CLI handles flow, state, I/O
- **AI for Intelligence**: Claude Code SDK for decisions, analysis, generation
- **Incremental Progress**: Save early, save often, never lose work
- **Metacognitive Learning**: Tools that analyze and improve themselves
