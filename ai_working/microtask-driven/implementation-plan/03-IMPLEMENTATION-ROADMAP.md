## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path from zero to a working Amplifier CLI Tool Builder in 25 days. Each phase builds on the previous, with clear deliverables and success criteria. The key to success is maintaining focus on:

1. **Microtask discipline**: Keep each AI call focused (5-10 seconds)
2. **Incremental progress**: Save after every operation
3. **Pattern reuse**: Build the pattern library continuously
4. **Metacognitive learning**: Learn from every failure

By following this roadmap, the team will build not just a tool, but the foundation for an entire ecosystem of AI-enhanced development tools.
