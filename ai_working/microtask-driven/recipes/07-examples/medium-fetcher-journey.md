# The Medium Fetcher Journey: From Process to Recipe

## The Origin Story

The Medium Fetcher didn't start as a module - it started as a problem: *"I have hundreds of articles saved in Medium that contain valuable insights for my work, but I can't effectively search or synthesize them."*

This case study shows how the process of building the Medium Fetcher could be captured as a recipe - not to duplicate the code, but to **replicate the thinking process** so it can be applied to other data sources.

## The Original Journey (What Actually Happened)

### Day 1: Initial Exploration

```markdown
Brian's Thought Process:
"I need to get my Medium articles. Let me check if they have an API."

Actions Taken:
1. Googled "Medium API"
2. Found official API is deprecated
3. Opened browser DevTools on Medium
4. Watched network requests while browsing
5. Found GraphQL endpoint
6. Noticed authentication via cookies

Key Discovery:
"They use internal GraphQL API with cookie auth. I can work with this."
```

### Day 2: Authentication Challenge

```markdown
Brian's Thought Process:
"Cookie auth means I need to capture my session. Let me see what's required."

Actions Taken:
1. Copied cookie from browser
2. Tested with curl - failed
3. Inspected headers more carefully
4. Found additional required headers
5. Built working curl command
6. Documented exact requirements

Key Learning:
"Medium validates multiple headers, not just cookie. Need full session context."
```

### Day 3: Understanding the API

```markdown
Brian's Thought Process:
"GraphQL means I need to understand their schema. Time to reverse engineer."

Actions Taken:
1. Captured various GraphQL queries from browser
2. Identified query for reading list
3. Found pagination cursor pattern
4. Discovered catalog ID requirement
5. Mapped response structure

Pattern Recognition:
"This is similar to other GraphQL APIs but with custom pagination."
```

### Day 4: Building the Fetcher

```markdown
Brian's Thought Process:
"Start simple, make it work, then make it good."

Implementation Order:
1. Hardcoded single request
2. Added pagination
3. Extracted to functions
4. Added error handling
5. Created configuration
6. Built CLI interface

Philosophy Applied:
"Each piece should work independently. Test as I go."
```

## Extracting the Recipe

Now let's extract the **metacognitive recipe** from this journey:

## Recipe: "Data Source Explorer"

### Purpose
Explore and integrate with undocumented or semi-documented data sources by following Brian's systematic exploration methodology.

### Cognitive Pattern

```yaml
name: Data Source Explorer
type: thinking-recipe
domain: Data Integration
author: Brian Krabach

cognitive_model:
  approach: "Pragmatic Reverse Engineering"
  philosophy: "Start with browser, understand the flow, replicate minimally"
  priorities:
    1: "Get data flowing"
    2: "Understand constraints"
    3: "Build reliable extraction"
    4: "Optimize later"
```

### Phase 1: Initial Reconnaissance

**Trigger**: Need to access data from service

**Thinking Pattern**:
```python
async def explore_data_source(service_name):
    """
    Brian's exploration methodology
    """
    # First instinct: Check for official API
    thought = "Is there an official API?"
    official_api = search_for_api(service_name)
    
    if not official_api or official_api.is_deprecated:
        thought = "No official API. Time to reverse engineer."
        # Brian's approach: Always check browser first
        strategy = "open_browser_devtools"
    else:
        thought = "Official API exists. Check if it meets needs."
        strategy = "evaluate_official_api"
    
    return strategy
```

**Decision Criteria**:
- Prefer official if available and sufficient
- Browser inspection for web services
- Mobile app inspection for mobile-first services
- Network capture as last resort

### Phase 2: Authentication Investigation

**Thinking Pattern**:
```python
async def understand_authentication():
    """
    Brian's auth investigation process
    """
    thoughts = []
    
    # Brian always checks simplest first
    thoughts.append("What's the simplest auth that might work?")
    
    auth_methods_to_try = [
        "api_key",      # Simplest
        "bearer_token", # Standard
        "cookie",       # Web-based
        "oauth",        # Complex but standard
        "custom"        # Last resort
    ]
    
    for method in auth_methods_to_try:
        if test_auth_method(method):
            thoughts.append(f"{method} works! Now understand requirements.")
            return investigate_auth_requirements(method)
    
    thoughts.append("No standard auth worked. Time to dig deeper.")
    return deep_auth_investigation()
```

**Brian's Heuristics**:
- "If it works in browser, I can make it work in code"
- "Start with curl to verify before coding"
- "Document everything - auth always breaks later"

### Phase 3: API Pattern Recognition

**Thinking Pattern**:
```python
async def understand_api_patterns():
    """
    Brian's pattern recognition approach
    """
    patterns = {
        'architecture': identify_architecture(),  # REST, GraphQL, RPC
        'pagination': identify_pagination(),      # Cursor, offset, page
        'rate_limits': identify_rate_limits(),    # Headers, behavior
        'data_format': identify_format(),         # JSON, XML, custom
        'quirks': []                              # Non-standard behaviors
    }
    
    # Brian's approach: Look for familiar patterns
    if patterns['architecture'] == 'GraphQL':
        thought = "GraphQL - need schema. Check introspection first."
        if not introspection_available():
            thought = "No introspection. Reverse engineer from queries."
            patterns['schema'] = reverse_engineer_schema()
    
    # Always test edge cases early
    patterns['quirks'] = test_edge_cases()
    
    return patterns
```

**Pattern Library** (Brian's accumulated knowledge):
- GraphQL → Look for Relay patterns
- REST → Check for HATEOAS
- Pagination → Cursor usually better than offset
- Rate limits → Check headers first, then behavior

### Phase 4: Incremental Implementation

**Thinking Pattern**:
```python
async def build_incrementally():
    """
    Brian's implementation philosophy
    """
    steps = [
        "Make it work (hardcoded)",
        "Make it reusable (functions)",
        "Make it robust (error handling)",
        "Make it fast (optimization)",
        "Make it beautiful (refactoring)"
    ]
    
    for step in steps:
        implementation = implement_step(step)
        
        # Brian's rule: Test before moving on
        if not test_current_implementation():
            thought = "Something broke. Fix before proceeding."
            debug_and_fix()
        
        commit_progress()  # Always checkpoint working state
```

**Implementation Principles**:
- One working feature > many partial features
- Test with real data immediately
- Commit working states frequently
- Refactor only working code

### Phase 5: Robustness Addition

**Thinking Pattern**:
```python
async def add_robustness():
    """
    Brian's approach to reliability
    """
    robustness_checklist = [
        "Handle authentication expiry",
        "Implement retry logic",
        "Add progress indicators",
        "Cache where appropriate",
        "Log enough to debug later",
        "Handle partial failures",
        "Make resume/restart possible"
    ]
    
    for item in robustness_checklist:
        if is_relevant(item):
            implement_robustness(item)
            # Brian's approach: Test failure scenarios
            test_failure_scenario(item)
```

## Applying the Recipe to New Domains

### Example: LinkedIn Article Fetcher

Using the Medium Fetcher recipe for LinkedIn:

```yaml
Recipe Application:
  Service: LinkedIn
  
  Phase 1 - Reconnaissance:
    - No official API for articles ✓
    - Open browser DevTools ✓
    - Found REST endpoints ✓
  
  Phase 2 - Authentication:
    - Cookie-based like Medium ✓
    - Additional CSRF token required (quirk)
    - Document the difference
  
  Phase 3 - Patterns:
    - REST not GraphQL (adaptation needed)
    - Different pagination (offset-based)
    - Similar rate limiting
  
  Phase 4 - Implementation:
    - Same incremental approach works ✓
    - Test with real LinkedIn data
    - Adjust for REST patterns
  
  Phase 5 - Robustness:
    - Same checklist applies ✓
    - Add LinkedIn-specific handling
```

### Example: Twitter/X Thread Fetcher

Using the recipe for Twitter:

```yaml
Recipe Application:
  Service: Twitter/X
  
  Adaptations Needed:
    - API v2 exists but limited
    - Browser inspection more complex (React)
    - Authentication stricter (bearer + csrf)
    - Rate limits more aggressive
  
  Recipe Still Guides:
    - Systematic exploration approach
    - Incremental implementation
    - Test-first methodology
    - Document quirks pattern
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Makes This a Recipe, Not Just Documentation

1. **Captures Thinking Process**: Not just "what" but "how to think about it"
2. **Includes Decision Criteria**: How Brian chooses between options
3. **Embeds Heuristics**: Rules of thumb from experience
4. **Adaptable to Context**: Can handle different services
5. **Preserves Philosophy**: Maintains Brian's pragmatic approach

### The Value of Process Replication

By capturing the Medium Fetcher journey as a recipe, we can:
- Apply the same thinking to any data source
- Train others in the methodology
- Improve the process over time
- Handle new integrations confidently

## Creating Your Own Journey Recipes

To create a recipe from your journey:

1. **Document as You Go**
   - Record decisions and why
   - Note what surprised you
   - Capture what you tried that failed
   - Save working checkpoints

2. **Extract Patterns**
   - What do you always do first?
   - How do you decide between options?
   - What are your fallback strategies?
   - When do you change approaches?

3. **Identify Transferable Thinking**
   - What would work for similar problems?
   - What's specific vs. general?
   - What expertise is embedded?
   - What would you teach someone?

4. **Codify into Recipe**
   - Create hooks for critical thinking points
   - Build agents for specialized thinking
   - Design commands for workflows
   - Test on new problems

## The Result

The Medium Fetcher Recipe is more valuable than the Medium Fetcher code because:
- **Code** solves one problem (Medium)
- **Recipe** solves a class of problems (any data source)
- **Code** becomes outdated when APIs change
- **Recipe** adapts to new situations
- **Code** requires understanding to modify
- **Recipe** can be applied without understanding

## Conclusion

The Medium Fetcher journey shows how capturing the process of creation is more valuable than the creation itself. By turning the journey into a recipe, we preserve not just the solution but the problem-solving approach that created it.

This recipe can now be:
- Applied to new data sources
- Improved through usage
- Shared with others
- Used to train digital teammates

The real power isn't in fetching Medium articles - it's in teaching AI to explore data sources the way Brian does, making his expertise scalable and transferable.
