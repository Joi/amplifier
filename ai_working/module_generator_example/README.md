# Module Generator Example Workspace

This workspace stores artifacts used to exercise the module generator CLI. It tracks:

- Planning notes for the `idea-fusion` pipeline CLI that processes markdown files.
- Contracts and implementation specs for sample modules (starting with the Idea Synthesizer) that the generator will materialize.
- Future results, logs, and verification plans.

Artifacts created here should be versioned so future sessions can reuse them for testing and regression checks.
